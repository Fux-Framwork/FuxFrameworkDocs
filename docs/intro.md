# Introduction

FuxFramework is a fast and lightweight MVC PHP framework, inspired by Laravel Framework. It offers all features you need
in order to create your next web application based on PHP: routes, controllers, middlewares, models etc...

FuxFramework tends to do things with less _magic_ than Laravel, especially when talking about database/model interaction.

It is structured in order to have a high initial learning rate (especially if you already used Laravel in the past) and 
to reduce the time to market for your next application.

Furthermore you have access to many ready-to-use classes and packages in order to push forward your app development.

## Planned features

- Automatic skeleton generator
- Integrated CSRF protection
- Use PDO and parametric queries instead of string sanitizers
- Integration with Inertia.js
